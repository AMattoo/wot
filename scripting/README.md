# W3C Web of Things - scripting API deliverable 

This directory is the work area of the Task force for a common scripting API for the Web of Things.

## Directory structure

The directory contains these contents:

* A directory ``proposals`` for discussion inputs and strawman-level examples
* A directory ``typescript-definitions`` containing the API definions in TypeScript to allow the usage of rich tooling
* A file ``use-cases.md`` describing the targeted use cases and recurring patterns, a.k.a. "atomic" use cases
* A file containing the compiled inputs that we reached consensus upon, that will be merged into ``current-practices``

## Task force

### Coordination & Work

Also the mailing list [public-wot-ig](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/) is used, ideally mark messages with [scripting]
