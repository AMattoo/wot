For additional information see the W3C IG WoT Wiki:
* [Design-Time Means](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Design-Time_Security%26Privacy_Means): survey of means to build/realize security&privacy architectures for WoT (elaborated but special interest; not moved to GitHub for this reason)
* [Runtime Means](): survey o means to understand the security&privacy status of a WoT system and keep it sane (not yet elaborated)
* [Advanced Concepts](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Security%26Privacy_Advanced_Concepts): elaborates on specific requirements such as authorization of things discovery as well as goals that require the composition of individual mechanism (is in early brainstorming state; not moved to GitHub for this reason)
