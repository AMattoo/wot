This archive contains both source vector graphics files (SVG or PPT),
derived vector graphics files (PDF) and rasterized images (PNG).
The images with an "ssm" suffix are 350 x 916 and are meant only for
preview.
The images with an "sm" suffix are 4800 x 12562 pixels and are
suitable for small 16" x 40" vertical banners at 300 dpi.  
The images without prefixes are 
suitable for printing on 32" x 80" vertical banners at 300 dpi
but are fairly large (9600 x 25125 pixels).
