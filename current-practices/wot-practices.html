				The Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group (IG) is collecting concepts and technologies to enable discovery and interoperability of Internet of Things services on a worldwide basis.
				The discussions of the interest group already shaped rough, preliminary WoT building blocks: thing description (TD), scripting API & protocol bindings (AP), discovery (DI), and security & privacy (SP). The current practices related to WoT building blocks were also prototyped and tested in so-called plugfests.
				The documentation of these WoT building blocks, however, are usually scattered across multiple drafts, meeting minutes, wiki entries, slides, and even verbal agreements.
				Thus, this document tries to provide an overall snapshot of the current practices of the WoT interest group in a single location.
				While this document is not a technical specification, it aims at helping implementers to get a quick overview of the WoT building blocks.
				Furthermore, it includes reports from past plugfests and follow-up discussions, which explain the rational behind the current practices.

			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>
				The Web of Things (WoT) interest group (IG) provides a forum for technical discussions to identify use cases and requirements for services based upon the role of Web technologies for a combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) with the Web of data.
				The IG has been divided into four task forces that looked into building blocks for such a Web of Things: thing description (TD), scripting API & protocol bindings (AP), discovery (DI), and security & privacy (SP).
				Apart from the planned deliverable of a technology landscape document which provides an overview of existing technology, also promising concepts and working drafts were discussed. It turned out challenging for implementers
				to follow the current state of the WoT building blocks respectively in these discussions.
				This is, however, very important for the mission of the <a href='#plugfests'>plugfests</a>, where the current practices should be tested and evaluated.
				Moreover, it is hard for newcomers to quickly get a picture of the IG activities.
				Thus, this document shall provide a snapshot that represents the current practices of the WoT IG.
				It preserves the results of the plugfests as well as the discussions between participants.
				This document is not a technical specification, but more a working document for implementors of the prototypical WoT building blocks.

				<h2>Thing Description</h2>
				<p>
					In the context of WoT, networks have to face the challenge of getting ever more complex. 
					The complexity arises as the number of interchanging heterogeneous Things and different 
					hardware resource classes always increase. When it comes to the development and the use 
					of such networks in the WoT domain, semantic technologies are seen as one way to tackle 
					this complexity. For example, properties and capabilities of resource constrained embedded 
					devices may be semantically described in order to enable an effective search over different 
					classes of devices, semantic data integration may be deployed to integrate data produced by 
					these devices, or Things may be empowered to reason about semantic data in the context of WoT 
					applications. 
					
					<p>
					The defined Thing Description (TD) of the WoT IG provides a minimal vocabulary set for describing a Thing. More precisely, 
					it is a semantically description of Thing’s capabilities in terms of API’s <code>Property</code>, 
					<code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code>. 
					In addition, it provides metadata for different communication bindings (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, etc.) and 
					security considerations of resources (if it needed).
					</p>
					<!--The Thing Description (TD) provides a minimal vocabulary for describing a thing based on
							<code>Metadata</code> and <code>Interactions</code>. Interactions are further divided into three
					categories namely  <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code>. -->
				<p>
					Figure xxx gives an overview which kind of relevant components are defined in the TD. The subsequent 
					subsection will give a more detail explaination of the components and its content.
				</p>
				</p>
		 

	 

				<section>
					<h3>Metadata</h3>
					Metadata is used to provide some generic information of a Thing. There are 3 mandatory and one optional vocabulary defined within the Metadata:
					 <ul> 
					 	<li>Name: Name of the Thing</li> 
					 	<li>Protocol: Which kind of protocol is supported (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, XMPP, etc,)</li> 
					 	<li>Encoding: Which kind of serialization format is supported (e.g., JSON, XML, etc.)</li>
					 	<li>Security: [optional]  Access metadata (self-contained) of the Thing for securely transmitting information of all Thing's resources </li>
					 </ul>
				      	<p>Besides of these 3 fix defined vocabularies additional characteristics can be defined such as product id, firmware 
				      	version, location, etc..
				      	</p>
				      	
				      	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Data</h3>

					<p>This field is used to define application-specific simple and complex data types that are used by the interaction 
					models (property, action, event).</p>
					
					<p>Per default, a subset of XML Schema simple data types is supported which includes string, int, float, byte, short, boolean, 
					unsignedByte, unsignedShort, unsignedInt, and hexBinary (=byte array).</p>
					
					<p>An input or output data field can be also assigned as empty which is equivalent to 'void' or 'null'.</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Property</h3>

					<p>The interaction variant Property is used to serve properties of a Thing which can be 
					static and/or dynamic (e.g., temperature value, fill level of water, etc.).</p>
					
					<p>There are 4 mandatory and 2 optional vocabularies defined within the Property:</p>
					<ul> 
					 	<li>Name: Name of the property</li> 
					 	<li>OutputData: Which data type is associated with this property</li> 
					 	<li>Writable: Is this property writable (true/false)</li> 
					 	<li>Href: Array of URLs of property's resource (can be also relativ to provided protocol information in
					 	metadate field) or URL of a redirection server to the property's resource </li>
						<li>Stability: [optional] Max time of stability of the property value in ms 
					 	(0ms=stable/static property value)</li>
					 	<li>Security: [optional]  Access metadata (self-contained) for securely transmitting information of the property </li>
					 </ul>
					
					<p>The href field can contain one or more URL entries in relation of the number of supported protocols of 
					the Thing. </p>
					
						<p>Note: If the property is writeable=true, then the property accepts inputData which has the same 
						data type as defined by the outputData.</p>
