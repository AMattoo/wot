# Testing and Validation

## Plan
* Investigate Spec Tracking tools
    - Kaz, Lagally – to investigate W3C requirements and tools 
    - Target date: third week of April
* Update specifications with clear normative assertions
    - Per task force - person assigned
    - Follow RFC2119: MUST (NOT), MAY (NOT), SHOULD (NOT) in all-caps to mark assertions
    - Target date: beginning of May
* Extract normative assertions
    - Ideally automatic; but worst case, manual
    - Target date: mid-May
* Update Test Definitions
    - Per deliverable – satisfy W3C requirements
    - Should track specification updates
    - Could associate with pull requests
    - Target date: mid-June
* Implement tests
    - Compare with current tests; check off definitions
        - Target date: end of June
    - Fill gaps
        -Target date: ongoing; done by spec release
    - Test suite - own repo
    - Online things and simulators - for continuous regression testing
