## Task force on Thing Description

This task force is chartered to address following aspects:

* Clarify and define what the TDL can be used for 
* Clarify and define what aspects of a Thing can be described
* Agreement on the three building elements: 
- What is a suitable data model underlying TDL 
- How would a vocabulary used in thing descriptions look like 
- What is an appropriate syntax / serialization format of TDL which is feasible for the Things (may be synchronized with the AP task force)
