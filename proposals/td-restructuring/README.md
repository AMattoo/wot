# Thing Description Restructuring
This document shall initiate the discussion to make some rearrangements of the TD structure. Beside of the WoT plugfest, TD is already used and evaluated in some projects and other IoT standardiziation activities such as in BIG IoT ([http://big-iot.eu/]) and OCF ([https://openconnectivity.org/]). There are some feedbacks for improvements which we should take into account.

## Today's TD Basic structure
