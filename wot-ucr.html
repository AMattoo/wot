            <p>Buildings often have a large variety of components such as Heating, Venting, and Air
               Conditioning (HVAC), lighting systems, and possibly more specialized systems such
               as support for reserving rooms electronically. Very often, these systems are not provided
               by a single supplier, but there still should be a single way how interactions with
               the overall building automation infrastructure are possible.
            </p>
            <p>Possibly, building automation scenarios can have layered services, such for example
               when it comes to temperature sensing. While the basic functionality of the building
               automation system might only include to get information about the current temperature
               in a variety of places, there also might be a "temperature history" service. This
               service might allow more advanced features such as accessing the complete history
               of temperature measurements, and possible even more advanced functionalities such
               as queries int this dataset. Again, such an advanced service should be accessible
               in the same way as the more basic services, so that developers can access all these
               services in a uniform way.

                        using a framework that makes those descriptions uniform even if the underlying sensors
                        or services are using different implementation technologies.

                        mechanism, so that application can subscribe to these events, and will be notified
                        when they happen. This increases the workload of the building automation system (it
                        has to keep track of subscribers), but may make development of certain classes of
                        applications much easier.

            <p>In companies like a large industry bakery you have storage facilities like silos to
               store production materials. In order to keep track of the amount of production material
               in the silos, level radar devices are used. The measurement data is collected by an
               order management system.

            <p>As soon as the production material falls below a certain threshold, the system sends
               an order to a delivery company.

            <p>Manufacturing plants and process automation plants not only have to be monitored on-site
               but also from remote locations. That is for example to compare KPI (key performance
               indicators) of different manufacturing sites and optimization of the production processes
               and outputs based on the collected data, for diagnosis, remote service support or
               predictive maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>For such a system you need a platform that collects the data from field level devices,
               from control level and also from applications on MES level. Applications can connect
               to the platform to retrieve the data for further processing (e.g., optimization algorithms).
               The open platform enables the connection between data points provided from devices/applications
               of different companies to applications from different parties (e.g., a software that
               provides trouble shooting information combined with online status information of devices
               in an optical head-mounted display).

            <p>
               A device, its network environment, and the applications
               installed on the device, need to be managed.  The relevant
               resources are typically represented in a hierarchical fashion
               (as modelled in the YANG schema language) and exchanged as
               collections or as subsets of a larger collection.
               Some of the resources can be so large that they seriously
               stress the runtime environment of the device (e.g., for
               firmware updates).
               Some of the subresources may appear and disappear dynamically
               (e.g., network prefixes).  Retrieval and update of the
               resources may refer to non-contiguous subsets of a hierarchy
               (PATCH, non-contiguous GET).  Traditional URI-paths may be too
               expensive for repeated transfer in requests.

               For instance, it is a task that involves various stakeholders (e.g., domain engineers,
               software engineers, system engineers, system installers etc.) and hence it is an error-prone
               task, it is often handled in a safety critical environment, it needs to be maintained
               over a longer timeframe (during which some of the stakeholders or parts of the system
               may not be available) and so forth.

            <p>Let us consider a use case scenario which, throughout the lifecycle management of
               an IAS, considers following tasks: Development of a new automation function, service
               or an app based on available resources and domain knowledge; Support for resource
               discovery, optimal selection and choreography of resources; Parametrization of resources,
               functions, services and apps; Support for adaptive services running in a dynamic environment
               (i.e., physical resources appear and disappear); Monitoring and diagnosis of resources,
               functions, services and apps; Optimization of automation workflows involving different
               resources and different lifecycle phases.
            </p>
            <p>From these activities, as found in a typical lifecycle management of an IAS, one can
               derive following requirements:

            <p>In loosely coupled systems, applications may encounter resources they have no prior
               knowledge about. Resource Description is a facility that allows resources to be described
               or describe themselves, so that applications can use those descriptions to learn about
               certain properties and/or capabilities of a resource. Resource descriptions on the
               highest abstraction level needs to provide two main facilities: identification of
               resources through some referencing mechanism, and description of resources through
               some data model.

            <h2>Content-Negotiation</h2>
            <p>For many interactions, it is necessary that peers agree on a shared data exchange
               format. There are various ways in which such a format can be defined, and in which
               agreement can be reached, but the general goal for all of these cases is that peers
               can reach agreement on which data exchange to use, and what it means to use this format.
               Depending on the type of data to be exchanged, different data exchange formats have
               different advantages and disadvantages, but generally speaking, the most important
               factor is that there is agreement on the representation of the data to be exchanged,
               and how to parse that into a model that is usable and useful for the application's
               goals.

            </h2>
            <p>RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate
               data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the
               evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
               RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship
               between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as
               a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data
               to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure
               forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between
               two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible
               mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

                        and by using attribute/value pairs that make statements about those URI-identified
                        resources. RDF descriptions can be of arbitrary complexity by joining triples to form
                        a graph, and they can use and combine various vocabularies so that the graph contains
                        information according to the concepts defined in those vocabularies.
