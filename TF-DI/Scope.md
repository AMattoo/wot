# W3C WoT TF-DI Scope

Wiki - http://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Discovery_TF
This document is part of Task Force on Discovery. The discussions on discovery will address the following aspects.

## Definition of discovery in general
* Understanding its purpose
* Applicability into various use cases

## Current landscape
* It is intended to survey the existing literature and mechanisms for discovery.
* Understand different discovery architectures i.e. centralized or P2P over distributed architecture
* Means of interaction used for discovery

## Scopes and dimensions of discovery
* Scopes could be further classified into local and remote
* Dimensions could be in terms of context, location, humans(from access control perspective) etc.

## Need to consider
* Registration and unregistration of WoT devices as a part of discovery
* Life-cycle of discovery
* Do we need an abstraction layer for communication technologies (NFC, BLE...) and investigate how they should relate to discovery?

## Brainstorming on
* What are you using to discover?
* What are you discovering - 

** It could be in terms of a physical thing or its description or an URI of thing

** Alternatively, it could also be mentioned in terms of resource, service and property

** Could also be local network discovery
* Clarify and define how Thing Description (TD) can be used in discovery

# Open questions/items
* Advertisement based discovery
* Beacon based discovery 
* Serverless discovery options (similar to bittorrent peer exchange)
* Taxonomy
* Use cases to consider
