# Web of ThinksThings Linked Data and Semantic Processing Task Force

**Confidentiality**: proceedings are public

**Initial Chair**: to be appointed

**Team Contact**: Dave Raggett

**Meeting Schedule**: phone call every 2 weeks with most work to be conducted asynchronously

## Introduction

The Web of things seeks to unlock the potential of the IoT by defining an abstraction layer that decouples applications from the details of the underlying IoT platforms, protocols and communications patterns. This is based upon the idea that things standing for physical or abstract entities are exposed to applications as software objects. These objects expose properties, actions, events and metadata, and are subject to application contracts that also define service level agreements around security, privacy, non-functional properties (e.g., location, price etc.) and the underlying IoT platforms. These contracts are formally defined in terms of W3C's Linked Data framework as a *lingua franca*, enabling multiple serializations such as JSON, XML, Turtle and so forth.

The application contracts can be used by application platforms to create the software objects for applications to interact with things. The contracts include the metadata needed by application platforms to drive particular IoT platforms. Semantic models can be used to support validation of application contracts, including domain constraints, validation of data, discovery based on the kinds of things, their relationships and context, and to ensure semantic interoperability for compositions of services.

## Scope

The Linked Data and Semantic Processing Task Force is responsible for:

- Gathering and surveying a broad range of existing and proposed use cases for the Web of things, and identifying Linked Data requirements for the application contracts exposed by application platforms.
- Creating demos and test suites to explore the requirements, and for use in outreach
- Exploration of the requirements for vendors to describe their product's unique features
- Exploration of areas where shared standards are appropriate, e.g. physical units
- Coordination with other Web of Things IG task forces
- Coordination with other W3C groups, e.g. Web of things WG, Semantic Web IG, ...
- Coordination with external groups, IoT platforms, Linked Data community, ...
- Incubation of techniques for validation and transformation of Linked Data

### Deliverables

The Task Force will produce Interest Group Notes, demos and test suites in keeping with its goals. The roadmap for this will be maintained by the Task Force Chair in consultation with members of the Task Force.

### Relationships to Other WoT IG Task Forces

The Linked Data and Semantic Processing Task Force will coordinate with other WoT IG Task Forces, e.g. in connection with liaisons for OCF, oneM2M and future liaison task forces for other IoT platforms.Â  Coordination is expected with the Thing Description Task Force on the requirements for application contracts in respect to information models, and with the Security Task Force in respect to security metadata.

### Relationships to Other W3C Groups

The strongest connection will be to the Web of things WG, but there is also likely to be a need for coordination with a variety of W3C groups, e.g. Semantic Web IG, RDF Data Shapes WG, Spatial Data on the Web WG, Automotive WG and so forth.

### Relationships to Groups External to the W3C

The Task Force will coordinate with external groups to exchange information and build a shared understanding. This includes IoT alliances and SDOs, as well as communities focusing on Linked Data, IoT pilots and so forth.
